//! Hand-off Block (HOB) emulation for Azure CVM environment
//!
//! When using AzCVMEmu with vmcall-raw, HOB emulation is not required.
//! This module provides minimal stubs that satisfy compilation requirements only.

// These types are kept minimal since they're not actually used in AzCVMEmu+vmcall-raw mode
// but are needed for compilation

#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]

/// GUID Extension HOB stub
#[repr(C, packed)]
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]

    pub header: Header,
    pub name: [u8; 16],
